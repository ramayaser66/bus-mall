# bus-mall

 we created a buss-mall website where it show its products in a list consists of three images that changes and shows all products when the user clicks on a picture and it keeps tracks to the products being clicked and renders the results in a chart to see what products had the highest rating from the users. 
all the data is then stored in the loacl storage so it can be accsesed when needed even if the page was closed or refreshed.
